"""
Comparison example showing both sync and async Vercel Projects API usage.

This example demonstrates the differences between sync and async approaches
by performing the same operations with both methods and comparing performance.

Requirements:
- VERCEL_TOKEN or VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN environment variable set
- Optional: VERCEL_TEAM_ID for team-scoped operations

Usage:
    python examples/projects_comparison.py
