# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the
full documentation for it [in the repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

For this Python project, use the wrapper script:

```bash
bash scripts/changeset.sh add
```

This generates an ephemeral `package.json` from `pyproject.toml`, runs the changesets CLI, and cleans up afterwards.
